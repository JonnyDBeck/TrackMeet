  ## Description:
  TrackMeet is a webpage created with the purpose of giving users a very convienant way to track workouts. This allows users to know how much calories are being burned in a set amount of time. They will also be able to follow up on past workouts and see what was done on a certain day. This works both for desktop use as well as mobile, but of course will be more leaned as a mobile friendly app for on the go tracking.
